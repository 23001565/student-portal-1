npm run dev

npm run stop

npm run backend

>>>> Typical workflow:

Change schema.prisma (add/modify models or fields)

Run prisma migrate dev → applies changes to DB and generates client

Use the updated Prisma Client in your code

If you only change something that doesn’t affect the DB but requires updating the client, you can just run prisma generate.
